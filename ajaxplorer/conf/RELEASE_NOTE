Demo : http://ajaxplorer.info/demo
Date : 2012-07-23
Rev Number : 3033

This is a bug fix release, and introduce two new features : simple but efficient documents automatic-versionning based on GIT,
and Amazon S3 driver. Other clouds drivers will come soon (Swift from Open Stack among others).

[NEW FEATURES]
Meta.git    : Git based versioning, way more simple than with svn, simply install GIT on the server and install the PEAR/VersionControl_Git library. Open in browser, revert to a given revision, cosmetics.
Access.S3   : Based on Pun'k Avenue s3 "better stream wrapper" implementation, and the aws-sdk from AWS (not packaged by default).

[BUG FIXES]
gui.mobile : open/info menu had disappeared (FilesList refactoring).
Auth.ftp & Auth.smb were broken
Notify.phpmail-lite : Base64_decode when necessary
Disable scheduler if not able to create db folder
Do not catch errors and exception at the very first boot
[core] Factorise generateAttachmentHeaders and generateInlineHeaders inside HTMLWriter, and use them in fsAccessDriver and in FileMimeSendSender.
[gui.ajax] Fix various things in JS files for FilesList class impermeability.
[access.smb] Make sure to register smb:// wrapper (bug in cross-repository copy)
[access.smb] Apply Thomas Oettli tweaks (new DOMAIN parameter).
[access.ajxp_confDriver] Not very nice, but working, make sure to register meta.svn & meta.git after the others (will trigger the hooks accordingly) @todo : generic reflexion on the hooks/plugins ordering.
[action.scheduler] Missing xmlEntities call on repositories list, could break the interface.
[action.scheduler] Make sure the folder is also initialize on unserialization
[meta.quota] Fix shell epression used for computing quota on Darwin
[core.auth] Wrong ajax response on pass-change error, reported by @ultreia
[AJXP_Utils] Fix from @mattlef : avoid exception on empty extension filename

[CLI & ASSOCIATED TEST]
CLI : detect / configure / use COM WScript.Shell to enable command line on IIS. Require giving correct rights to the cmd.exe executable.
Typo error totally breaking the PHPCLI test.
Test CLI : more tests on safe_mode & exec detection to be sure it will not crash

[WebDAV]
Disable locking for the moment, triggering too much random upload problem
[Quotas] webDAV and quota checking
[WebDAV] Fix error if a repository has no metastore
Conf.sql :  getRepositoryByAlias was simply broken, making webDAV fail when using conf.sql
GoodReader WebDAV client : do not urlEncode

This is a major stable release that includes numerous bugfixes from the 4.1.0 and a lot of new features.

[NEW FEATURES]
Auth.multi driver       : Implement an alternative MODE, instead of proposing the various drivers to the user, consider one is the master (typically ldap) and the other is the local alternative (typically serial) to allow creating shared users.

Replication         : Ability to replicate groups of fields in the standard form kit.
Config files        : New (optional) way of encoding serial files using JSON formatting. We may switch massively to this format, as it's much more easy to hack manually (but would have to check performances before).

User case           : Disable case sensitivity (in core.auth config)
